# Reasoned Art Manifesto

1. In the age of immediacy, we must rediscover our ability to think long term and conceive an ethical *human project*[^1].
2. We are called upon to intervene and have an active dialogue with regard to art, res publica, and the co-design of sensitive cities.
3. We must implement a participatory and conscious governance of innovation to solve our massive cultural, social, environmental, and economic problems. 
4. The market must take cultural responsibility and implement a benefit model to build a better society and a healthy, clean environment. 
5. Technology is becoming hybridized with our bodies: it amplifies and modifies our sensory, emotional, and physical capacities.
6. We live onlife, between the digital and the physical, in the infosphere and *hyper-history*[^2].
7. Decentralization gives back autonomy and identity to each individual, promoting a circular system.
8. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are 'tangible' assets in the intangible world of the metaverse. 
9. Art goes *beyond itself*[^3] and manifests itself in a multidisciplinary and multi-sensory way in order to achieve a new social centrality.
10. Art manifests itself in physical and digital communities of individuals living in new fluid and dynamic habitats.
11. Art intercepts the future and offers an innovative vision of the present.
